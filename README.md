Walk in the footsteps, through the Lake District, of William Wordsworth and be challenged whether he was sinner or saint with this informative tour guide app. The Wordsworth Lake District Trail – available in iPhone and android formats – is an essential Lake District travel companion, which takes you on a guided tour of Wordsworth’s life, from tormented father of a deserted love child in France to socially acclaimed poet laureate. Written by seasoned journalist John Nash and available in English and Japanese language downloads, it offers a thought-provoking review of Wordsworth’s well know literary ‘shrines’. There are room-by-room accounts from Wordsworth House; Dove Cottage and Rydal Mount; as well as features on Dora’s Field, the daffodils meadow he planted in memory of his daughter; the glorious Wordsworth’s Seat rocky outcrop viewing point on Rydal Water; and his humble burial place at St Oswald’s Church. What is more, the app briefly examines the complex, if not bizarre lifetime relationship he had with his sister Dorothy – she wore his bride-to-be’s wedding ring the night before his marriage; the celebrity-style break-up with fellow Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge; and the heartbreak which drove him into inconsolable grief.
